About 1,200 years ago, the large Marleyan city of Lago was destroyed by Titans of the Eldian Empire over the course of a single day. The Titans would continue their advance and went on to commit "The Devastation of Monte" and "The Ravaging of Valle" which resulted in the deaths of hundreds of thousands of Marleyans.[10] Grisha Yeager claimed these are all lies;[11] however, he was in denial of Eldia's brutal history of war and slavery.
