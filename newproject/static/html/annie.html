She possessed the ability to transform into a Titan known as the Female Titan. Trained from an early age by her father,[12] she is selected as one of Marley's Warriors. In the year 845, she is sent on a mission to retrieve the Founding Titan, along with fellow Warriors Reiner Braun, Bertolt Hoover, and Marcel Galliard. As the Female Titan, she serves as a major antagonist prior to her defeat, at which point she crystallizes herself and is left in a comatose state.[13] She was held underground in the custody of the Survey Corps for approximately four years before escaping during a battle between the Military, the Yeagerists, and the forces of Marley.
