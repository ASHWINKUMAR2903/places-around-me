Levi is seen leaving Trost District, along with the rest of the Survey Corps, on the 56th Expedition Beyond the Wallsâ€”the same day the Colossus Titan attacks the district.

While on the expedition, Levi sees a soldier caught in the jaws of a nearby Titan and kills it. As more Titans approach, Levi orders Petra Ral to take care of the injured soldier while he takes care of the remaining Titans. After clearing the immediate area, Levi checks on the injured soldier, who is quickly succumbing to his injuries. In an attempt to comfort the scout in his dying moments, Levi assures him that he has done his duty well. As the soldier dies, Erwin arrives and informs Levi that they are returning to Trost. Levi is unwilling to turn back so soon, is forced to concede when Erwin informs him that Wall Rose has possibly been breached.
